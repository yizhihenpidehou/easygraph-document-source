Installation
============

For users of Windows, MacOSX, and Linux, we recommend using Python's 
package management system, `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable>`_ .
EasyGraph's site on PyPI - `Link <https://pypi.org/project/Python-EasyGraph/>`_

**Installation with** ``pip``
::

    $ pip install Python-EasyGraph

`Conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_ works on Windows, MacOSX, and Linux, 
which serves millions of people managing package, dependency and environment for
Python and other languages.

To use EasyGraph in conda, you can create a new conda environment, which specifies Python version >=3.6, <3.10

**Example installation with** ``conda``
::
    $ conda create -n easygraph python=3.6
    $ conda activate easygraph
    $ conda install -c fudanmsn Python-EasyGraph

.. hint::
    EasyGraph uses `tensorflow 2 <https://www.tensorflow.org/install>`_ for machine 
    learning functions. If cuda settings for GPU are not well deployed in your PC, you will
    get similar warning messages as the followings when using tensorflow-based methods
    (e.g. easygraph.functions.graph_embedding.line.LINE):
    ::
        2020-11-09 13:40:31.453228: W tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:59] Could not load dynamic library 'cudart64_101.dll'; dlerror: cudart64_101.dll not found
        2020-11-09 13:40:31.456194: I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cudart_stub.cc:29] Ignore above cudart dlerror if you do not have a GPU set up on your machine. 

    Note that this does not prevent the codes from running normally, because tensorflow will
    leverage CPU in case GPU cannot be used. If you want to use GPU, this `link <https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu>`_ might be
    helpful for GPU settings.
